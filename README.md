This is a Design Patterns and Object-Oriented Programming Shop Project made in using windows forms C# and SQL Database. 

This project is divided into 4 parts:   
  1) The shop part where the user chooses what car he would like to buy. All the data is stored in the database.   
  2) A brick breaker game.   
  3) The form for the employees where they can ask for a promotion, remove junior employees if they are senior...
  4) The Owner of the shop form. His code is encoded and stored in text files. The owner of the shop can de whatever he wants (Add/ remove employees, see the bills, 
  create XML file, add cars, assign tasks to employees, binary search, compare the salary of employees using comparers, pay the bills, sort the employees, decode his code, 
  create a new code...)  
  
  The employee part and the owner of the shop part have all of their data stored in text file with a specific character between the data to be able to get them back easily. 
  In this project, the main class is the Person class. Employee, Admin and User are its derived classes. The two classes named: engineers and sales derive from the Employee 
  class.  
  
  The following were used: Dictionnaries, Lists, Linked Lists, Arrays, Encapsulation, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Aggregation, Base and Derived class, 
  Sealed class, Abstract class, Override, XML, Binary Search, Delegation, Events, Collections, Comparer, Synchroneous and Asynchroneous calls, StreamReader, StreamWriter, 
  TextReader, TextWriter, StringBuilder, Directories and Files, Lambda expressions, Exeption Handling, FileStream, Predicate, Encodings, LINQ to SQL...
